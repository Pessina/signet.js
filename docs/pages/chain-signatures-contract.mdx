# Implementing a custom Chain Signature Contract

This guide explains how to implement a custom Chain Signature Contract for signing payloads with Sig Network MPC.

## Overview

The `ChainSignatureContract` is an abstract class that defines the interface for interacting with Sig Network infrastructure. It provides methods for:

- Key derivation
- Transaction signing

The contract should be provided when instantiating a Chain instance.

The library currently provides a default implementation for Near but you are free to implement your own.

## Using the Near Implementation

```ts twoslash
import { utils, EVM } from 'signet.js'
// [!include ~/snippets/env.ts]

const contract = new utils.chains.near.ChainSignatureContract({
  networkId: 'testnet',
  contractId: 'v1.signer-prod.testnet',
  accountId,
  keypair,
})

const evmChain = new EVM({
  rpcUrl: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID',
  contract,
})
```

## Implementing a custom Chain Signature Contract

The custom contract should implement the `ChainSignatureContract` interface.

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/../src/chains/ChainSignatureContract.ts]
```

### Example of Near Implementation

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/../src/utils/chains/near/ChainSignatureContract.ts]
```
