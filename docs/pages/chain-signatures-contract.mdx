# Implementing a Custom Chain Signature Contract

This guide explains how to implement a custom Chain Signature Contract to provide as argument when instantiating a Chain instance.

## Overview

The `ChainSignatureContract` is an abstract class that defines the interface for interacting with the Sig Network infrastructure.

- Key derivation: Derived the child key from the root key using Sig Network Key Derivation Function
- Transaction signing: Sigs the given payload using Sig Network MPC
- Get the root public key: Gets the root public key from the contract
- Get the current signature deposit: Gets the current signature deposit to handle network congestion

While the library includes a default implementation for the NEAR protocol, you have the flexibility to implement your own contract for other blockchain networks.

## Using the NEAR Implementation

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/env.ts]
// ---cut---
import { utils, EVM } from 'signet.js'

const contract = new utils.chains.near.ChainSignatureContract({
  networkId: 'testnet',
  contractId: 'v1.signer-prod.testnet',
  accountId,
  keypair,
})

const evmChain = new EVM({
  rpcUrl: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID',
  contract,
})
```

## Implementing a Custom Chain Signature Contract

To create your own implementation, your contract must implement the `ChainSignatureContract` interface.

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/../src/chains/ChainSignatureContract.ts]
```

### Example: NEAR Implementation

Below is the reference implementation for the NEAR, which you can use as a guide for implementing your own chain signature contract:

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/../src/utils/chains/near/ChainSignatureContract.ts]
```
