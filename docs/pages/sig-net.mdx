# Sig Network

## What is it?

Chain Signatures enables cross-chain communication through ECDSA/EDDSA signed payloads. We're bringing Chain Signatures to every major Blockchain and ecosystem.

When two networks can sign, their smart contracts can verifiably and directly communicate. This creates a TCP/IP-like protocol for Blockchain, eliminating disjoint networks.

Say goodbye to wrapping, bridging, liquidity balancing, and atomic swaps. With Chain Signatures, you can:
- Directly send transactions
- Hold assets
- Receive responses on any chain in any smart contract

This is true Chain Abstraction.

## Our Numbers

### Team Building
**18** teams are currently building products using Chain Signatures on NEAR.

### Latency
**400ms** - We enable cross-chain experiences without the wait. No extra lag communicating between chains or when abstracting your account.

### Transactions Per Second
**300 TPS** - With our unique horizontally scalable architecture, our MPC network's throughput will scale to 300 transactions per second and beyond. This allows us to connect to as many Blockchains as we like without slowing down or having congestion pricing.

## Network Roadmap

### NEAR (August 2024)
- Launched audited Mainnet MPC network
- Providing signatures for all NEAR smart contracts
- First NEAR applications launched
- Many more applications on testnet

### Scale Up (April 2025)
- Deploy to 8 of the most developed Blockchains
- Scale network to handle increased demand

### Token Launch (June 2025)
- Launch governance token
- Token usable on all supported networks
- Pay for signatures
- Stake to validate

### MPC Contracts (November 2025)
- Allow developers to deploy programs on all supported networks
- Run privately with encrypted inputs and outputs
