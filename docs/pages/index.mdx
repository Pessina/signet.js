## Introduction + How It Works

### What Are Chain Signatures?

Chain Signatures let you manage and use cryptographic key(s) across multiple chains or multiple contexts, with on-chain-enforced conditions. The system:

- **Derives keys** from a single base key.
- Allows third parties (e.g., dApps, wallets, or protocols) to request ECDSA signatures on-chain.
- Introduces flexible usage controls, such as daily spending limits or rate limits, by combining these keys with custom on-chain logic.

#### Benefits & Use Cases:

- **Multi-chain** or cross-chain setups are enabled using chain signatures. For example your Ethereum contract can hold and transact with native Bitcoin.
- **Arbitrary restrictions** (e.g. Rate or time-based - “this key can only send up to 1 ETH per day”) can be enforced by the on-chain contract that manages key usage.
- **Recovery or fallback** conditions: Instead of storing private keys in a single hardware device, you can use a multi-party computation (MPC) setup.
- **Signs the arbitrary state of a foreign chain:** Gives your smart contract awareness of whether a transaction it signed went through so that it can perform actions accordingly. For example: allows for a smart contract to keep track of local chain assets based on foreign chain state.

### Contract Background

The **ChainSignatures** contract:

- Holds a base public key (`publicKey`), expressed in affine coordinates on the secp256k1 curve.
- Derives new public keys for each `(user, path)` combination by computing an integer `epsilon` (based on a `path` string and user’s address) and performing an EC point addition:
  ```
  DerivedPubKey = BasePubKey + (epsilon × G)
  ```
- Allows a user to request a signature on a 32-byte payload by calling `sign(...)`. A minimal deposit may be required to discourage spam; any unused deposit is refunded once the request is completed.
- Awaits the **MPC network** to compute the actual ECDSA signature offline, then call `respond(...)` with that signature. The contract then emits an event with the signature, and refunds the deposit.
